Routines based on the Kubo formalism to calculate transport properties in bulk and interfaces.
The operators such as spin and orbitals, can be constructed as it is shown in each example. The SHC is already implemented within Sisl, but it might be useful to play with the other routines for stdudiyng transport properties based on Kubo as well.
